# JavaFX-CreateFXML
There are two ways to create a user interface, one is to define it through an XML file, and the other is to create it directly through java code. Here use XML to create most of the interface.

After that, open the fxml file with Scene Builder, then it will show a fixed interface design area.

Whenever the interface design is basically completed, the interface can be Previewed to test the design.


## Create the main application

A new *FXML* file as the main layout file is also needed, which will contain the menu bar and store the fxml file created earlier.

  Create a new FXML Document in the view package called RootLayout.fxml, this time, select BorderPane as its root node

  Open the FXML file with Scene Builder, use Pref Width and Pref Height to set the size of *BorderPane*. Then add a MenuBar on the top.

## The JavaFX Main Class

A main java class is needed to load RootLayout.fxml and add PersonOverview.fxml to *RootLayout.fxml*. This main class will be the entrance of the application.

  Select New|Other, then *JavaFX Main Class*

  Name this class Main and place it in the controller package

The Main.java generated by the IDE inherits from Application and contains two methods at the same time. This is the most basic code structure of a JavaFX application. The most important method here is start (Stage primaryStage), which will be passed when the application is running. The internal main method is automatically called.
  
The start(...) method will receive a Stage type parameter. The following figure shows the basic structure of a JavaFX application.

The Stage here is a main container, which is usually a window (with sides, height and width, and a close button). In this Stage, you can place a Scene, of course you can switch to other Scenes, and in this Scene, various controls can be placed.
